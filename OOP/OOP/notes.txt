-- Classes, objects, instance variables and class variables --

Each object is a different instance based in a same class. If we
print an object the result will be a location of memory.

Instance variables: Instance variables contain unique data that is unique
to each instance.

Class variables: Are variables that are shared among all instances of
a class.

** variables instances can be unique for each instance. Class variables
should be the same for each instance. **

-- Class methods and Static methods --

Class method: we receive the class as our first argument instead of
the instance. Sometimes class methods are using to create different ways
to create an object. some constructors.

Instance method: we receive the instance of the object as our first argument.
They are used to modify an unique instance instead the class and not affect
all objects only itself.

Static method: Don't pass any argument. No self or cls. They behave just
like regular functions and we include them in our classes because
they have some logical connection with the class.

-- Property Decorators --

@property: we do that a method works like a property. You access it like
a property

@fullname.setter: we access a method like a property and if you want change it
you only change it like an any property
