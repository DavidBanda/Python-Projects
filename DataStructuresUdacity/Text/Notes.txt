Algorithm:

2.- A program that solves a problem
3.- series of steps for solving a problem

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Structures:

1.- Different ways of storing data on your computer
2.- A way to store and organize data in a computer, so that
it can be used efficiently

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               _
Arrays          |    1) Logical view
Linked list     |    2) Operations
stack            }   3) Cost of operations (time)
queue           |    4) Implementation
tree            |
graph          _|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Define ADT (Abstract Data Types): define the data that we'll store and then we
define the operations available with the type and we do not go to into the
implementation details

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Efficiency or complexity: is how well you are using your computer's
resources to get a particular job done.

space and time: how long does your code take to run?, and how much storage space
do you need?.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big O notation: O(n)

 - Where 'n' is an expression algebraic
 - Amount of lines in code.
