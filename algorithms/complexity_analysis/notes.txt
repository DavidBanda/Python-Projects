Time Complexity:
Time complexity is just a measure of how fast an algorithm or a solution runs

Space Complexity:
How much memory or space an algorithm uses up

An algorithm will take space and time to execute, and we call this
relationship space-time complexity

Logarithm:
If I am dividing N in half, in each operation, this is log(n). And if I
double the size of the input, am I only performing one extra operation, it
is also log(n)
