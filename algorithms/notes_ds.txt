    LIST-BASED COLLECTIONS

Linked list: A linked list is an array but in each element we store a direction of
memory to the next element. We can add ilimitation elements.

Stack: Is like a linked list but when we add a element, that element will be
the last in out. LIFO (Last In, First Out)

Queue: Is like a stack, but here is FIFO. (First In, First Out)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    SEARCHING AND SORTING

Binary search: when we search in an array, we start comparing our element
with element that is in the middle, if its bigger the element is on the second
array, if its not the element is in the first array. And we do this until we
found the element.

        -----------|---|2^0|2^1|---|2^2|---|---|---|2^3|
       |array size | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
       |-----------------------------------------------|
       |iterations | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
        -----------------------------------------------

        - Big O: O(|power of 2| + 1 ) = O(log2(n) + 1) = O(log(n)) (for aproximation)
                   |exponent  |               ^
                                              |
          - 2^3 = 8 : log2(8) = 3 -------------


Recursion: You call the same method over and over. You need 3 steps:

            - first step: a function that calls itself.
            - second step: a base case. (exit condition).
            - third step: alter the input parameter at same point.

            Recursion might look and feel really pretty,
            but it isn't always the best way to approach a problem.
            Save it for problems that can be broken into tree like structures.
            When there's a balanced treelike structure, the recursion will
            make things cleaner and faster. We're talking about things like

            - Binary search trees.
            - Merge sort.
            - Quicksort.
            - Searching file structures.

            Recursion is like a boomerang, if the recursion works good,
            all the results gonna go to you again.


BubbleSort: You compare the first element with the second element, if the second element
            is less than the first, you swap that two elements. And continue with
            the second element, you compare the second element with the third, and do
            it again. And you do that until end of array. In the first iteration
            the biggest number go end of array. So Big O is n^2. To get the sort array
            we need to do n^2 comparations. We can transform n^2 in two nested for.

            - Big O(# iterations)(# of comparations) = (n - 1)(n - 1)
                O(n^2 - 2n + 1) = O(n^2)


MergeSort:  You divide an array in two arrays. You do that until each element of the
array gonna be an array with an unique element. Like recursion works like a boomerang,
when the  two first elements back, they gonna be an array with two element, now you
have to sort it and return it, and over and over, until the array gonna be the same at
the start.

            -----------|2^0|2^1|---|2^2|---|---|---|2^3|---|
           |array size | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
           |-----------------------------------------------|
           |iterations | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
            -----------------------------------------------

            - Big O(|#comparations| * #steps) = (n log(n))
                    |per step     |                 ^
                                                    |
            - 2^2 = 4 : log2(4) = 2 -----------------


QuickSort: You take a pivot, normally the last element and compare it with the first
element. If the first element is greater than the last, you take the first element and
put it behind the last element. To do that you take the penultimate element, and put it
where was first element, first element in where was last element and last element
where was the penultimate element. Example:

            - [21, 9, 3, 1, 4, 20, 25, 6, 23, 14]
            - [23, 9, 3, 1, 4, 20, 25, 6, 14, 21]

You do that until all left elements be less than pivot, and all right elements greather
than pivot. You do the same thing with the element left and right until array gonna be
sorted.

    MAPS AND HASHING

Set: A collection of things, but is different to a list. A list has some kind of
ordering for its elements. A set doesnt have that but instead doesnt allow for repeated
elements

Map: Is a set-based data structure. map = <Key, Value>. A group keys is a set. A key only
exist once in a map.

Hash: the purpose of a hash function is to transform some value into one that can be
stored and retrieved easily. You give it some value, it converts the value based on
some formula, and spits out coded version of the value thats often the index in an array

    - Collision: As it turns out theres a flaw in our elegant system. There are times
    when a hash function will spit out the same hash value for two different inputs.
    This situation is termed a collision.

    TREES

Terminology:

    - Root: The first element in a tree is called root.ç
    - Node: Individual elements in a tree that contain values are often
    called nodes.
    - Level: Connections + 1
    - Leaf: Nodes at the end that don't have any children are called
    leaves.
    - Edges: You can call connection edges, and a group of connections
    taken together as a path.
    - Height: Is the number of edges between the node and the furthest
    leaf on the tree.
    - Depth: Is the number of edges to the root.

    - Complete Tree: Every single level is field up except the final level,
    if the final level has nodes, they should be field up to left to right
    - Full tree: Its a full tree if every node in the tree has k-ary tree or
    0.
    - Perfect tree: All the leafs nodes have the same depth.


Tree Traversal:

    - Depth-first search (DFS): Is if there are children nodes to explore,
    exploring them is definitely the priority.

        - Pre-order traversal: We start at the root and check it off, then
        we visit its children, the left one first and check it off too. We
        continue traversing down the left most nodes until we had a leaf.
        When we arrive to a leaf we check it off and go back up to the
        parent and then traverse to the right node and check it off too.
        We do this until we check off all nodes, then we back up to the
        root node and do the same thing in the right node.

        - In-order traversal: Is the same thing that in pre-order, but
        check off its different. We only check off a node when we visited
        its left child node.

        - Post-order traversal: We won't be able to check off a node until
        we've seen all of its descendants or we visited both of his children
        and returned.

    - Breadth-first search (BFS): Priority is visiting every node in the
    same level we're currently on before visiting child nodes.

        - Lever Order: Start at the root, then visit its children on the
        second level then all of their children on the third level until
        you've visited every single leaf. (We start on the left most side
        of the level and move right)
